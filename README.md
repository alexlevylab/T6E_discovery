# Description of the scripts

**commands_for_sequence_and_structure_analysis.sh**
- This script provides the main commands used for clustering of sequences and structures of Type VI Secretion System specialized effectors
- This inlcudes the parameters used in the published paper
- Versions used are listed in the manuscript Materials and Methods
  
**grep_vgrG_PAAR_hcp_and_faa.sh**
- This script contains the commands for extracting domains and sequences of T6E core domains from a locally downloaded subset of the IMG database
- More information about are listed in the manuscript Materials and Methods

**run_trained_model_gh.py**
- This script takes in a csv with pTM and ipTM scores generated by alphafold multimer, and outputs a prediction of binding/non-binding based on our trained logistic regression model
- The script also needs the scaler of the ipTM scores: **scaler_iptm_ptm_gteq0.5.pkl**
- The trained logistic model weights are also taken into the script: **trained_model_iptm_ptm_gteq0.5.pkl**
